To properly configure the code, follow these steps:

1. Signal Polarity Alignment:
   Before proceeding, ensure that all signals have the correct polarity relative to each other, as specified in the timing chart. Pay special attention to the following signals:
   - ST
   - f(CLK)
   - SAVE_PIN

2. Data Output Testing:
   After verifying signal polarity, it's essential to test the data output from the DATA_PIN. Check if the data is being stored correctly in the designated array. 
   use to see stored data:
   ```c
   void showData(uint16_t sensorData[])
   ```

3. Gap Width Measurement Parameter:
   Next, configure the parameter for gap width measurement. Define the parameter:
   ```c
   #define DistanceToSensor  // Specify the distance in millimeters
   ```

4. Stepper Control Loop Parameter:
   Finally, set the parameters for the stepper control loop:
   - 
     ```c
     #define Kp 0.01 // Adjust as needed
     #define Kd 0.01 // Adjust as needed
     #define MAX_INTEGRAL 10  //Adjust as needed
     ```
   - Tolerance:
     ```c
     #define TOLERANCE 1 // Specify the error tolerance for stepper control in millimeters
     ```
5. Mouse measurment : call the CalibrationMouse(char axe); to set this parameters
   
     ```c
      float xCalibrationFactor   0.0  // Adjust as needed
      float yCalibrationFactor   0.0  // Adjust as needed

By following these steps, you will ensure that the code is properly configured and organized for your application.
